# Case Bundles & Auditing

TaskX introduces "Case Bundles" as a meta-layer for ingesting, auditing, and reviewing task execution across environments.

## Vocabulary

### Case Bundle
A zip archive containing a snapshot of a TaskX execution context. It is the primary unit of transfer between an Implementer and a Supervisor.

**Contents:**
- `manifest.json`: Cryptographic proof of content (SHA256).
- `task_queue.json`: What was planned.
- `runs/`: What was executed (including evidence and logs).
- `repo_snapshot/`: Git state and environment metadata.

### Implementer Report
A JSON artifact generated by the agent (or human) performing the work. It answers:
- **Status**: Did it pass, fail, or get blocked?
- **Summary**: What happened?
- **Changes**: What files were touched?
- **Verification**: What proof exists that it works?
- **Deviations**: Did we stray from the plan? (Must be explicit).

### Supervisor Review
A JSON artifact generated by the reviewer (human or specialized agent). It answers:
- **Decision**: Accept, Reject, or Revise.
- **Reasons**: Why?
- **Next Action**: What should happen now? (e.g., "Merge PR", "Retry with X").

## Schemas
The structure of these artifacts is strictly enforcing by schemas in the `taskx_schemas` package:
- `case_bundle.schema.json`
- `implementer_report.schema.json`
- `supervisor_review.schema.json`
