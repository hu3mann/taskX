# Installation

Canonical install and integration instructions live in:

- `01_INSTALL.md`

This page is intentionally short to avoid drift. Use the README guide for:

- `.taskx-pin` based installs
- `project shell` wiring
- `project upgrade` stabilization flow
- `route` assisted routing commands
- `pr open` assisted PR flow
