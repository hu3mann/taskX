# Case Bundles & Auditing (Maintainers)

TaskX introduces "Case Bundles" as a meta-layer for ingesting, auditing, and reviewing task execution across environments.

## Vocabulary

### Case Bundle

A zip archive containing a snapshot of a TaskX execution context. It is the primary unit of transfer between an Implementer and a Supervisor.

Contents:

- `manifest.json`: cryptographic proof of content (SHA256)
- `task_queue.json`: what was planned
- `runs/`: what was executed (including evidence and logs)
- `repo_snapshot/`: git state and environment metadata

### Implementer Report

A JSON artifact generated by the agent (or human) performing the work. It answers:

- Status: did it pass, fail, or get blocked?
- Summary: what happened?
- Changes: what files were touched?
- Verification: what proof exists that it works?
- Deviations: did we stray from the plan? (must be explicit)

### Supervisor Review

A JSON artifact generated by the reviewer (human or specialized agent). It answers:

- Decision: accept, reject, or revise
- Reasons: why
- Next action: what should happen now (for example, merge PR or retry with a different approach)

## Schemas

The structure of these artifacts is enforced by schemas in `taskx_schemas`:

- `case_bundle.schema.json`
- `implementer_report.schema.json`
- `supervisor_review.schema.json`
