# Kernel Principles

These are constraints, not suggestions.

---

## I. The Packet Is Law 👑

If it's not in the packet, it does not exist.

---

## II. One Path Only ⚔️

One invocation.
One route.
One outcome.

---

## III. Refusal Over Deception 🧾

Better a clean refusal than a dirty guess.

---

## IV. Artifacts Are Sacred 📌

Console output is noise.
Artifacts are truth.

---

## V. No Hidden Behavior 🚫

No retries.
No fallback.
No secret second chances.

---

## VI. Determinism Above All 🔥

Same input.
Same output.
Every time.

---

## VII. Version With Honor 🧠

If the contract changes, the version changes.
No silent drift.
